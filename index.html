        <h4>"People think that mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the simple bit, it’s the stuff we CAN
            understand. It’s cats that are complicated." ~ John Horton Conway</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>John Horton Conway</strong> was an English mathematician active in the theory of finite groups, knot
            theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He made contributions to many
            branches of recreational mathematics, most notably the invention of the cellular automaton called the
            <em>Game of Life</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Born and raised in Liverpool, Conway spent the first half of his career at the University of Cambridge
            before moving to the United States, where he held the John von Neumann Professorship at Princeton University
            for the rest of his career. On 11 April 2020, at age 82, he died of complications from
            COVID-19.
