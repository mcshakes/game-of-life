            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                John Horton Conway (26 December 1937 â€“ 11 April 2020) was an English mathematician active in the theory of
                finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He also made
                contributions to many branches of recreational mathematics, most notably the invention of the cellular
                automaton called the Game of Life.
                Born and raised in Liverpool, Conway spent the first half of his career at the University of Cambridge
                before moving to the United States, where he held the John von Neumann Professorship at Princeton University
                for the rest of his career. On 11 April 2020, at age 82, he died of complications from COVID-19.
